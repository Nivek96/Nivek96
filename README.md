Web Developer | Web Designer, I am mostly a front-end web designer and use HTML - CSS with some JS knowledge. I'm currently working on developping my area with REACT JS, I already have a junior level in it, my aim is to pass to intermediate so if you want to mentor me, you are welcome to give me some tips and advices.
